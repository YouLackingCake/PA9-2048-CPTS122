# 2048 Game
***
PA-9 for CPT_S 122 at Washington State University.

## Description
This is a basic application for the game 2048 created in C++ and SFML.
By pressing WASD or arrow keys, merge tiles that have the same number to create 2048! Comes with three game modes: classic, multiplier, and exponential.

The game works best in x86 mode, not sure why but x64 has been causing some strange bugs and crashes.
